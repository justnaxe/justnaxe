# Personal Introduction

## Greetings,

Welcome, esteemed individual. I appreciate this opportunity to share a brief overview of myself, considering your presence here.

### Allow Me to Introduce Myself

I am addressed as Pavel, although within online spheres, I prefer to be referred to by my chosen username.

Pronouns: He/Him

MBTI: ISTP-T

Languages: Russian (native), English (B2|CEFR)

### Self-Identification

I am an unpretentious young gentleman hailing from the northern reaches of Tambov region(or state dunno i dont care). I am currently 15 years of age. Although this could serve as an adequate endpoint, I am inclined to divulge my interests, which include limited engagement with guitar playing (alongside some experimentation within FL Studio) and a penchant for the collection of antiquated electronic devices.
